#### Load data ####

# Annual
# All sites for which we could calculate annual VWM
n_annual_vwm <- readRDS("data_working/nitrogen_annual_VWM.rds")

# Sites that were actually used in annual-scale trend analyses
n_annual_vwm_filtered <- readRDS("data_working/nitrogen_annual_VWM_good.rds")

# And annual trends that were calculated.

#### Figures ####

##### HB only #####

# This is to illustrate the W6 record at Hubbard Brook, which
# many will be familiar with.

##### All sites #####

# This is the base plot that all others should be built
# around since it includes all possible sites (n = 182).

##### Trends #####

# set of site-wys that passed our filters that we'll use
# to create a new column.

# Joining this with the site metadata df too to combine
# information about experimental/non-experimental sites
# and those that passed the filters in the same column.
n_annual_vwm <- n_annual_vwm %>%

# And now to actually color said trends.
